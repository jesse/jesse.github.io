# Problem

Build a webpage that shows math problems for a user to solve.

# Tasks
- Build the entire app in index.html
- Do not download any frameworks or external assets like CSS or JS files. Add the JS and CSS directly on the page.
- Write a function to generate random addition and subtraction problems. There should be a slider on the page from 1 to 5 to increase the difficulty of the problems. 1 should be hard enough for a first grader and 5 should be high school level.
- Show only one math problem at a time in the format: A + B = ?, where the ? is an input box for the user to type the correct answer. Also add a submit button.
- On submit, print "Correct" and go to the next math problem if the answer is correct. Otherwise, print "incorrect", clear the user's input so they can try again.
- Create a mix of addition and subtraction problems.
- Since only one problem will be shown at a time, make it really big and legible.
- Design it to be kid friendly, for a 1st grader.
